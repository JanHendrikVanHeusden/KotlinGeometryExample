# KotlinGeometryExample

This project features code to support Fortezza Guild Night "Kotlin - 10 reasons why".

It contains 2 source root directories / packages directories, with obvious names:
* #### Kotlin sources: `nl.jhvh.kotlin` (`src/main/kotlin/nl/jhvh/kotlin`)
* #### Java sources: `nl.jhvh.java` (`src/main/java/nl/jhvh/java`)

The 2 packages have the same code, with the "same" code in Kotlin and in Java, respectively.

Spot the difference!
